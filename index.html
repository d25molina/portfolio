<h1>Dimas Molina</h1>
    <p>I am a second-year graduate student, enrolled in UC San Diego's online Master's of Data Science program. Prior 
      to attending UC San Diego, I earned my AS-T degree in Mathematics from Antelope Valley College in 2020, where I graduated
      Magna Cum Laude as a member of the college's Honors program. I then transferred to California State Polytechnic University,
      Pomona and earned my BS degree in Mathematics in 2022, also graduating Magna Cum Laude.
